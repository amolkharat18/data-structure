## What is Data Structure? (2 Marks)

A data structure is a way of organizing, storing, and managing data in memory so that it can be accessed and processed efficiently.

Example:
A Stack is a data structure where elements are added and removed using the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle, like the Undo operation in MS Word, where the last action is undone first.

## **Explain ADT with suitable example** (2 Marks)

An **ADT (Abstract Data Type)** is a data type that defines **a set of operations and their behavior**, without specifying the **implementation details** of how the data is stored.

Example:
**Stack ADT** defines operations such as **push()**, **pop()**, and **peek()**, but it does not specify whether the stack is implemented using an **array or a linked list**.
